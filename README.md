# TransArt: A Multimodal Application for Vernacular Language Translation and Image Synthesis
To develop a web-based application that first translates text from Tamil to English and then uses the translated text to generate relevant images. This application aims to demonstrate the
seamless integration of language translation and creative AI to produce visual content from
textual descriptions.

# Approach

1. Model Selection:

     *  Select a robust Tamil to English translation model from Hugging Face, such as
for example Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-ta-en.

     *  Choose a reliable text-to-image model, example like
CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4, to generate images from the translated text.

     *  Integrate a text generation model like gpt-3 or gpt-neo or google
gemini api for producing creative English text based on the translated input.

2. Application Development:
    
     *  Build the app using gradio or stremlit to handle translation and image
generation requests.

3. Integration and Testing:
 
     *  Integrate the Hugging Face models using their APIs.

     *  Conduct thorough testing to ensure accurate translations and image relevance.

7. Deployment:
   
     *  Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access.

## Features

1. **Language Translation**
   - Utilizes models like `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-ta-en` for accurate vernacular-to-English text translation.

2. **Text-to-Image Generation**
   - Leverages reliable text-to-image models such as `CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4` to create visually engaging images from the translated text.

3. **Creative Text Generation**
   - Integrates text generation models like `GPT-3`, `GPT-Neo`, or Google Gemini API to produce imaginative English text based on the input.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Built with Gradio, offering a simple yet powerful interface for translation and image generation tasks.
